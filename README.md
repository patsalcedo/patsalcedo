### Hello! 👋
Welcome to my GitHub :octocat:! My name is Patricia Salcedo. I'm currently a Junior Java Developer at [Chelmer Limited](https://chelmer.co/).

I'm interested in learning as much as I can in pretty much any aspect of software engineering! The long-term goal is to become a full-stack developer. Since I work as a backend developer by day, at night (and weekends!) I plan to improve my front-end development skills.

I also love learning about game design 🎮 and have recently started my game development journey!

- 👩🏽‍🎓 Graduated First Class Honours in Bachelor of Engineering at [AUT University](https://www.aut.ac.nz/) - specialised in Software Engineering and minored in Networks & Security.
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- 👩🏽‍💻 Currently learning: Unity (C#), 3D modelling in Blender, JavaScript
- ⚡ Fun fact: I enjoy dancing 💃 and training in Muay Thai 🥊
