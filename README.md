### Hello! 👋
Welcome to my GitHub :octocat:! My name is Patricia Salcedo. I have recently completed my fourth and final undergraduate year at [AUT University](https://www.aut.ac.nz/) studying the Bachelor of Engineering (Hons.), where I specialised in Software Engineering and minored in Networks & Security.

I'm interested in learning as much as I can in pretty much any aspect of software engineering! The long-term goal is to become a full-stack developer. At moment I am in the JAva world as a Junior Java Developer at Chelmer. 

I also love learning about game design 🎮
