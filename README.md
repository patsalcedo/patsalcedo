### Hello 👋
Welcome to my GitHub :octocat:! My name is Patricia Salcedo. I am currently a fourth-year undergraduate student at AUT University, studying the Bachelor of Engineering (Hons.), specialising in Software Engineering and minored in Networks & Security.

I'm interested in learning as much as I can in pretty much any aspect of software engineering!
I also have a keen interest in game development, particularly in terms of game design 🎮
