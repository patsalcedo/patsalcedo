### Hello! 👋
Welcome to my GitHub :octocat:! My name is Patricia Salcedo. I'm currently a Java Developer at [Chelmer Limited](https://chelmer.co/).

I'm interested in learning as much as I can in pretty much any aspect of software engineering! The long-term goal is to become a full-stack developer. Since I work as a backend developer by day, at night (and weekends!) I plan to improve my front-end development and app development skills. 

I also love learning about game design 🎮.

- 👩🏽‍🎓 Graduated First Class Honours in Bachelor of Engineering at [AUT University](https://www.aut.ac.nz/) - specialised in Software Engineering and minored in Networks & Security.
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- 👩🏽‍💻 Currently learning: Flutter
- ⚡ Fun fact: I enjoy dancing 💃 and training in Muay Thai 🥊
- 📫 How to reach me: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/patriciasalcedo/)
